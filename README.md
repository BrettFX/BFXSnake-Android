# BFXSnake-libGDX

## A colorful retro implementation of the game snake

This game was designed from scratch using libGDX. It features a colorful retro implementation of the game snake.

The player has the choice to hop right into the game after installing, or they can tweak a few settings from the main menu such as enabling or disabling the controller and music, or changing the color of the snake and the pickups.

Not many people think about beating the game snake. However, there is an end-goal implemented into this game. The player must pickup up the target winning score. The target winning score it dependent on the device's screen that the game is being played on. Once the play picks up the target winning score, the game will be won!

The player's high score is tracked and displayed at the main menu. The player is notified when they have reached a new high score during the game. The high score can be reset from the main menu.

All sound effects and music was created from scratch. The button clicks were created by recording an actual button being clicked. The other sounds and music were created with other software.
